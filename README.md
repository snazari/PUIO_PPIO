# Positive Unknown Input Observer disturabnce estimation simulation
The files in this repository are used to perform a simulations pertaining to estimating the disturbance and state of a positive system using a posititve unknown input observer (PUIO).

# How to run the simulation
Just type PUIOPPIO.m in MATLAB. Make sure the Simulink file PUIOPPIOsim.xls is located somewhere on the path.
